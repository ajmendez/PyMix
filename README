Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

* Required Packages

        # Python (version 2.5+ recommended, tested with 2.7)
        # Numpy  (version 1.6?, tested with 1.6)
        # GSL GNU Scientific library
    
* Optional Packages

        # GHMM for mixtures of HMMs
        # pylab for plotting functions in plotMixture.py

* How to install ?

    Extract the tarball to some directory of your choice. 
    Change into the directory and run:
    
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install --prefix=/some/where
    
    If you wish to pull down the github version you can use pip:
    
        pip install git+https://github.com/ajmendez/PyMix.git
    
    After the installation is completed I would recommend to run 
    mixtureunittests.py to check whether everything is in order.
    
    To get the GSL on OSX I recomend using homebrew to build the universal
    package so that it works with both the i386 version in EPD:
        
        brew install gsl --universal
